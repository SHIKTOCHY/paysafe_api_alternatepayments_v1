# Technical Introduction
This section provides a technical introduction to the Paysafe Alternate Payments API. 

## API Endpoints

The Paysafe Alternate Payments API is available in the Test environment for integration testing purposes. 
To switch between the Test and the live Production systems you  need only to change the endpoint URI and the 
credentials.

The following endpoints form the basis of a resource URI:

    Test endpoint - https://api.test.paysafe.com/alternatepayments/v1/

    Production endpoint - https://api.paysafe.com/alternatepayments/v1/

Because the Test environment is completely isolated, any changes you perform on your Test accounts configuration
(such as secure IP registration, APP registration, etc.) may have to be repeated in your Production account.


## Versioning

The API version will influence the request/response object structure as well as the functionality that is available through the API. A new version of the API will  be introduced only if we roll out a backwards-incompatible change that may impact your existing integrations.  As your API version can be maintained through the merchant portal, you can manage when to upgrade to the latest version, helping ensure your integration is not disrupted as new functionality becomes available.

### Major Version

The major version \(i.e., /v1/ \) represents a major technology shift between versions of the API. Changes in the 
major version are reserved for large-scale changes to the API that fundamentally change integration requirements
from the previous version.  Modified business domain models, re-design of functional flows, or change in API 
resource patterns are all considered major changes.  Changes to a major version are rare and typically require 
an extended deprecation cycle \(~2 years\) from prior versions to allow all consumers of the API to adapt.

> Your integration should take the following backwards-compatible changes into consideration so as not to break when additional fields are added to the API.

**What is considered a backwards-compatible change?**

* Adding API resources or adding new properties to existing API resources
* Modification to the order of parameters or JSON object elements
* Adding optional request parameters to API methods
* Adding webhook event types

**What is considered a backwards-incompatible change?**

* Removal of an API resource
* Removal of an API resources object attribute
* Changes to required parameter/JSON object elements
* Removal of previously supported API call

## Authentication 

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

> Key ID = MerchantXYZ<br/>
> Key Password = B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key ID and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key ID:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=`

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.


## Pagination

API calls that return multiple resources will wrap the response as a named JSON array.  For example, a collection of "payment" objects would
be returned as "payments". By default, 10 items at a time will be returned and you can navigate to the next set of resources using the 
supplied HATEOAS links.  List responses will also include a meta data section that will identify the number of records included in the collection,
the number of records per page (limit), and the current page number.
<br/><br/>
For example, if a request to look up payments identifies that there are 134 payments and you have set your limit to 15, the first 15 items will be returned with navigation links to provide the next 15 items in the list. If you navigate to the next page using the provided HATEOAS link, you will then retrieve items 16-30 with a new navigation link provided to return to the previous page, as well as a link to continue to the next page of items.

> _You can change the default list page size by defining a **limit** parameter value._

|Parameter Name |Description|
|---            |---|
|limit          |The number of records to be returned per page. Default = 10, Max = 100|
|offset         |Identifies your location within the list and allows you to fetch the next set of resources|
|startDate      |This is the start date in UTC. Default value is 30 days before the endDate.|
|endDate        |This is the end date in UTC. Default value is the current date and time.|

    }]
}
```

## Resource Expansion

Resource expansion can be compared to eager loading in the database realm. It offers a way to load a specific resource as well as other resources related to it. You are encouraged to use resource expansion when you know you are going to need the extra information. This will reduce the number of API calls as well as the amount of traffic to and from your server. You should avoid resource expansion when you want to reduce the amount of information returned or if you are unsure if you will need the additional resource object.
<br/><br/>
By adding an **expand** query parameter to the query you are effectively telling the server to include the details for the reference object in-line.  Any time you encounter an object that contains an "_expandable" section, you will know that the resources
identified are expandable. Passing that resource name as part of your **expand** parameter list will automatically include the associated resource details in your response.
<br/><br/>

For resources that have multiple expandable children, you can specify which resources to expand in a comma-separated list. <br />
For example, <strong>?expand=resource1,resource2</strong>

> Resource Expansion is available only when a single resource is involved. When you look up resources that could return collections of 
> results, the **_expandable** option will not be present. (I.e., if you query for a specific subscription, then **_expandable** will be available 
> for related resources such as the customer profile and associated plan for the subscription).  When a collection of related resources 
> relates to the particular resource you are looking at, a HATEOAS link will be provided instead. A good example of this would be a
> plan and its related subscriptions.  

<br/>
Below is a sample account lookup. By default the events resource is not expanded and instead includes a 
reference link that would provide the relevant details. If you would rather have the full account object returned, 
then add the **'expand=events'** parameter to your request and you will see the second events returned in-line.
<br/>

## HTTP Responses

HTTP response codes are used to indicate the status of a request.

**HTTP Status Code Summary**

|HTTP Response Code Category|Description|
|---|---|
|1xx: Informational|Communicates transfer protocol–level information|
|2xx: Success|Indicates that the client’s request was accepted|
|3xx: Redirection|Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete the request|
|4xx: Client Error|Indicates that the client has made an error with the request|
|5xx: Server Error|Indicates that an error occurred on the server side|

**Common HTTP Response Status Codes**

|HTTP Status Code|Description|
|---|---|
|200 OK|Everything worked as expected|
|201 CREATED|The request was successful. Paysafe created a new resource and the response body contains the representation.|
|202 ACCEPTED|This indicates that the client’s request will be handled asynchronously. It tells the client that the request appears valid, but it still may have problems once it is processed.|
|204 NO CONTENT|This is usually returned in response to a PUT, POST, or DELETE request, when the REST API declines to send back any status message or representation in the body of the response message.|
|304 NOT MODIFIED|The client's cached version of the representation is still up to date.|
|400 BAD REQUEST|This often indicates that a required parameter is missing or that a parameter is invalid. This is a generic client-side error status, used when no other 4xx error code is appropriate.|
|401 UNAUTHORIZED|This indicates that the client tried to operate on a protected resource without providing the proper authorization. They may have provided the wrong credentials or none at all.|
|402 PAYMENT REQUIRED|The parameters were valid but the request failed.|
|404 NOT FOUND|The requested resource does not exist.|
|405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED|The client tried to POST or PUT to a resource that would not accept it.|
|415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE|The request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.|
|429 TOO MANY REQUESTS|The application is sending too many simultaneous requests.|
|500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR|An error occurred with an internal server.|
|502 EXTERNAL SERVER ERROR|We received an invalid response from the upstream gateway in attempting to fulfill the request.|


## Errors

To ease integration and support for developers 
integrating to our APIs, the error messages that are returned should be verbose enough to correct the problem.  

The error structure contains a code as well as a human readable message. 
Additionally, the application error code will be returned in the header as *x-application-error-code* 
so it can be easily used by an application without parsing the body.

## HATEOAS

The Alternate Payments API uses a RESTful endpoint structure and relies on HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
to determine what action you are attempting to perform on a specific resource.

Each API call response includes an array of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) links. 
These links can be used to integrate subsequent flows and typically they will provide you information as to
what you can do next.

By using these links, you no longer need to hardcode your integration to call specific endpoint URLs to utilize
our API, but rather can use the returned URL for the specific purpose as defined by the 'rel' definition.

#### HATEOAS Link Structure

|Element  |Description|
|---      |---|
|rel      |Link relation that describes how this link relates to the previous call. Examples include self (get details of the current call), parent_payment (get details of the parent payment), or a related call such as to execute a refund on the payment.|
|href     |URL of the related HATEOAS link you can use for subsequent calls.|


Below are sample HATEOAS links from an API rsponse that returns a collection of payments. Links
are provided to navigate through the set of resources in the collection.
```
"links": [{
    "rel": "self",
    "href": "https://api.paysafe.com/alternatepayments/v1/payments/234243242?limit=10&offset=10"

> In addition to specifying *paymentType* as part of your API request, if the desired payment method also requires additional attributes, 
> these should be passed as a nested object in the root of your payment request.

> For example, an iDeal payment requires the following attributes are included in your request:
>
>
```
{
    "paymentType": "IDEAL",
    "ideal": {
