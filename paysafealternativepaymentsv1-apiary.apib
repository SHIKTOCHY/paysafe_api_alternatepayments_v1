# Technical introduction
This section provides a technical introduction to the Paysafe Alternative Payments API. 

## API Endpoints

The Paysafe Alternative Paymenes API is available in the sandbox environment for integration testing purposes. 
To switch between the sandbox and the live production system you only need to change the endpoint URI and the 
credentials.

The following endpoints form the basis of a resource URI:

    Sandbox (Testing) endpoint - https://api.test.paysafe.com

    Production endpoint - https://api.paysafe.com

As the sandbox environment is completely isolated, any changes you perform on your sandbox accounts configuration
(such as secure IP registration, APP registration) may have to be repeated in your production account.

## HTTP Responses

### HATEOAS

The Alternative Payments API uses a RESTful endpoint structure and relies on HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
to determine what action you are attempting to perform on a specific resource.

Each API call response includes an array of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) links. 
These links can be used to integrate subsequent flows and typically they will provide you information as to
what you can do next.

By using these links, you no longer need to hardcode your integration to call specific endpoint urls to utilize
our API, but rather can use the returned url for the specific purpose as defined by the 'rel' definition.

#### HATEOAS Link Structure

|Element  |Description|
|---      |---|
|rel      |Link relation that describes how this link relates to the previous call. Examples include self (get details of the current call), parent_payment (get details of the parent payment), or a related call such as execute or refund.|
|href     |URL of the related HATEOAS link you can use for subsequent calls.|
